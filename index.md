# CT4106 Lectures Overview

The Quantum Programming Foundations Course (CT4106) is offered from ICHEC aimed at providing exposure into quantum computing with minimal technical prerequisits. It is evolving, and we intend to add more modules with time to make it more comprehensive and inclusive of the skills and knowledge of the quantum computing ecosystem. Below are the list of modules currently offered. This page serves as the landing page for the lecture notes for each of the vidoe lectures in CT4106.
