```{admonition} Affiliation and activities

The National Centre for Scientific Research "Demokritos" (NCSRD) (www.demokritos.gr) is a self- governing research organization, under the supervision of the Greek Government. With a staff of over 700, including 100 post-graduate students and over 300 research associates, NCSRD is the biggest research centre in applied sciences and engineering in Greece. 
The Institute of Informatics and Telecommunications - [IIT](https://www.iit.demokritos.gr/), one of the five Institutes of NCSRD, has accumulated substantial expertise and is actively involved in many areas of information technologies including Quantum information technologies, mobile applications and telecommunications, while it has participated in numerous EU and nationally funded research projects. NCSRD’s IIT is involved in technological research and it has been participating in a number of European projects in the above mentioned fields such as the Quantum information domain, namely: OPENQKD, HellasQCI and others
[Syndesis Ltd](https://www.syndesis.eu/), a spin-off from the NCSR "Demokritos", grounded in a solid background in informatics, software engineering, digital security, and trusted computing ensures its leading role in  developing the central hub for PQC utilising AI technologies. Its participation in the OPENQKD pilot project and HellasQCI project highlights its advanced expertise in PQC technologies and standardisation efforts. Syndesis is an active member of standard development organisations (SDOs) like CEN/CENELEC JTC 22 and the QuIC, where it leads the standards working group. The company's contributions to the development of the CEN/CENELEC FGQT roadmap for standardising quantum technologies in the EU demonstrate its role in quantum standardisation.

## Summary of lecture

```{admonition} Summary
:class: information
He will first touch upon what is information, and how do we quantify it. He will describe aspects of information, such as transferring from point A to point B, encoding and decoding information, and measuring information. He will describe the distinction between classical and quantum information, and tools for measuring quantum information.

He will then dwelve into aspect of information security, particularly encryption. He will describe what cryptography is, and how it is used to safely transfer information for the right recepient, and protect it from third party. He will discuss symmetric and assymmytric cryptography, and digital signatures.

This will be followed by some demos on cryptography, and then he will discuss Quantum enabled cryptography, quantum key distribution (QKD), quantum random number generation, and challenges in quantum cryptography, and introduce post-quantum cryptography (PQC). He will conclude the lecture after discussing some necessary aspects of PQC.
