                            <li>Adding the second term (n=3) creates a waveform that begins to show the sharp transitions of the square wave</li>
                            <li>The third term (n=5) further improves the approximation, making the flat sections flatter and the transitions sharper</li>

                        <p>As we add more terms, the approximation becomes increasingly accurate. The Gibbs phenomenon causes overshoots near the discontinuities, which never completely disappear but become narrower with more terms.</p>
                        <p>Each additional term adds higher frequency components, which contribute to the sharper transitions in the square wave. This illustrates why square waves contain many harmonics, which is important in audio engineering and signal processing.</p>

                        <p><strong>1. Equation for the chord:</strong></p>
                        <p>The two notes can be combined by adding their waveforms:</p>
                        <p>\\(y(t) = \\sin(2\\pi\\cdot440t) + \\sin(2\\pi\\cdot880t)\\)</p>

                        <p><strong>2. Wave phenomenon:</strong></p>
                        <p>When these notes are played together, we can apply the trigonometric identity:</p>
                        <p>\\(\\sin(\\alpha) + \\sin(\\beta) = 2\\cdot\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\alpha+\\beta}{2}\\right)\\cdot\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\alpha-\\beta}{2}\\right)\\)</p>
                        <p>In our case:</p>
                        <p>\\(\\sin(2\\pi\\cdot440t) + \\sin(2\\pi\\cdot880t) = 2\\cdot\\sin\\left(2\\pi\\cdot\\frac{440+880}{2}t\\right)\\cdot\\cos\\left(2\\pi\\cdot\\frac{880-440}{2}t\\right)\\)</p>
                        <p>\\(= 2\\cdot\\sin(2\\pi\\cdot660t)\\cdot\\cos(2\\pi\\cdot220t)\\)</p>
                        <p>This shows the combined waveform can be interpreted as a tone with frequency 660 Hz (between the two original frequencies), with its amplitude modulated by a cosine function with frequency 220 Hz. This creates an effect where the volume fluctuates at a rate of 220 Hz.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>3. Relation to beats in music:</strong></p>
                        <p>The example above is a special case where one frequency is exactly double the other, creating a harmonious sound. In the more general case, when two tones of similar but slightly different frequencies are played together, the same principle creates 'beats'.</p>
                        <p>For example, if we play tones with frequencies 440 Hz and 444 Hz, we get:</p>
                        <p>\\(\\sin(2\\pi\\cdot440t) + \\sin(2\\pi\\cdot444t) = 2\\cdot\\sin(2\\pi\\cdot442t)\\cdot\\cos(2\\pi\\cdot2t)\\)</p>
                        <p>Now the amplitude modulation occurs at a frequency of 2 Hz, meaning the volume pulsates 2 times per second, creating an audible 'beating' effect. Musicians use this phenomenon when tuning instruments - when the beats slow down and disappear, the notes are in tune.</p>
                        <p>This principle extends to more complex combinations of notes in music and forms the basis for concepts like consonance, dissonance, and harmony.</p>
