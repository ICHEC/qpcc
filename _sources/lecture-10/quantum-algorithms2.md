```{admonition} Learning Outcomes
:class: tip
In this lecture we will be taking a look at the landscape of quantum algorithms, and talk about two of the layers of the quantum stack shown in the right, namely the applications and quantum algorithms. The learning outcomes of this lecture will be the following : 
- Introduction to quantum algorithms and their applications.
- Grasping potential advantage of quantum algorithms.
- Understanding the requirements for the practical application of quantum algorithms.
