# Lecture 12: Quantum Computing in Ireland

```{admonition} Overview
:class: tip

This week consist's of two lectures.
- Recorded Lecture on Quantum Computing in Ireland, covering Irish footprint in Quantum, and
- Guest lecture from Oxford Quantum Circuits (OQC).
```

## Summary

```{admonition} Quantum Computing in Ireland
:class: tip

We have a recorded lecture, covering Irish footprint on Quantum computing. We recall the scientist from Ireland whose discoveries helped the quantum computing, discuss the current research and industry activities in quantum computing, and describe ICHEC's positioning in the quantum computing ecosystem in Ireland.

:class: tip

**Title: Quantum Computing - From Superconducting Hardware to Real-World Applications**

**Presenter bio:**

**Daria Van Hende** is a Quantum Software Engineer at OQC, specialising in quantum compilation and quantum applications. She works at the intersection of hardware-aware quantum algorithm development and quantum software, focusing on making quantum algorithms more efficient, scalable and tailored to quantum hardware. She holds a PhD in Quantum Chemistry from Ghent University, Belgium, where her research focused on the application of quantum information theory to explain the behaviour of molecules in chemical reactions
