# Lecture 12: Quantum Computing in Ireland

```{admonition} Overview
:class: tip

This is a placeholder for the in house lecture from ICHEC. It will be populated in due time with necessary prerequisits, and supplementary content on ICHEC's activities on quantum computing.
```

## Summary

This is a live lecture, and covers Irish footprint on Quantum computing. We recall the scientist from Ireland whose discoveries helped the quantum computing, discuss the current research and industry activities in quantum computing, and describe ICHEC's positioning in the quantum computing ecosystem in Ireland.
