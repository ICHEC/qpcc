```{admonition} Learning outcomes
:class: tip

In this lecture we discuss the mathematical framework and tools required to properly understand how quantum system works. We give a short introduction to notion of vector spaces, linear operators, and how they connect to physical reality.
```

## Postulates of Quantum Physics

- State as an abstract vector
- Superposition principle
- Role of interference
- Principles of measurement
- No-cloning
- Entanglement
- Tunnelling 

## Mathematica Structure
