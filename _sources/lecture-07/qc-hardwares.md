## About the Guest
``````{admonition} The Speaker: David Redmond
:class: information

David Redmond received the B.E.E. degree from University College Cork, in 1988, and the M.Sc. degree in mathematics from University College Dublin, in 2017. He was involved in the semiconductor industry for more than 30 years developing high volume consumer and industrial products from handset 2/3/4G RF transceivers, to SerDes and Gigabit Ethernet products for such companies, such as AT&T Lucent, S3, Motorola, Freescale, and Analog Devices, operating at various levels of corporate research and development and product development. Since 2020, he has been with Equal1 Labs for VP AI & silicon. His research interests include machine learning and statistics.
