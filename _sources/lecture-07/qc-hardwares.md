## Summary of lecture

```{admonition} Summary
:class: information

We will explore together what makes up a superconducting quantum computer, how a superconducting quantum computer works, and how itâ€™s controlled (via microwave pulses). As we will be using a superconducting quantum computer during the session, please make sure to create an account for IQM Resonance ahead of the session using this link:
