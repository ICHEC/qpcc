```{admonition} Lecture Summary

We will explore what makes up a quantum communication network, how quantum communication networks are deployed, and how they are managed. We will start with an overview of quantum key distribution (QKD) networks and move to measurement device independent QKD networks and on to entanglement distribution networks. This evolution paves the way for the quantum internet and we will discuss some of the challenges we face in developing technologies for realising the quantum internet and the complex applications it promises.
