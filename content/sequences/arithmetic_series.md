# Arithmetic Series

## Arithmetic Sequences Revision

### Theory

Before we explore arithmetic series, let's refresh our understanding of arithmetic sequences. This foundation is crucial because a series is simply what happens when we add up the terms of a sequence.

Remember, an arithmetic sequence is a list of numbers where each term increases (or decreases) by the same amount each time. This constant difference is what makes these sequences so predictable and useful.

$$a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$$

Where:
• $a_n$ = the nth term
• $a_1$ = the first term
• $d$ = the common difference
• $n$ = the position number

The key insight is that once you know the first term and common difference, you can find any term in the sequence.

### Application

#### Examples

##### Example 1: Quick Sequence Review
Let's warm up with a familiar problem: Find the 12th term of the arithmetic sequence 4, 7, 10, 13, ...

**Method 1: Using the Formula**

$d = 7 - 4 = 3 \quad \text{(identify the common difference)}$

$a_{12} = 4 + (12-1) \times 3 = 4 + 33 = 37 \quad \text{(apply the formula directly)}$

## Arithmetic Series

### Theory

Now that we're comfortable with arithmetic sequences, let's take the next exciting step: arithmetic series. Here's the key difference - while a sequence is a list of terms, a series is the sum of those terms. This is where arithmetic sequences become incredibly powerful for solving real-world problems.

**What is an Arithmetic Series?**

An arithmetic series is what you get when you add up the terms of an arithmetic sequence. Instead of just listing the terms like 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, we're asking: what's 2 + 5 + 8 + 11 + 14?

**The Big Question:** How do we add up many terms without actually adding each one individually? This is where the magic of mathematical formulas comes in!

**The Sum Formula for Arithmetic Series:**

There are two equivalent formulas, and both are incredibly useful:

$$S_n = \frac{n}{2}[2a_1 + (n-1)d]$$

$$S_n = \frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n)$$

Let's understand what each piece means:
• $S_n$ = the sum of the first n terms
• $n$ = how many terms we're adding
• $a_1$ = the first term
• $a_n$ = the last term we're including
• $d$ = the common difference

**Which Formula Should You Use?**

Here's a helpful way to think about it:
• Use the first formula when you know the first term, common difference, and number of terms
• Use the second formula when you know the first term, last term, and number of terms

**The Beautiful Logic Behind the Formula:**

The second formula $S_n = \frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n)$ has a beautiful interpretation: it's the average of the first and last terms, multiplied by the number of terms. This works because in an arithmetic sequence, the terms are evenly spaced!

**Key Properties to Remember:**

**Symmetry:** In an arithmetic series, terms equidistant from the ends always add up to the same value. For example, in the series 1 + 4 + 7 + 10 + 13, notice that 1 + 13 = 14 and 4 + 10 = 14.

**Linear Growth:** As you add more terms to an arithmetic series, the sum grows quadratically (think parabola), not linearly. This is because you're not just adding more terms, but those terms are getting progressively larger (or smaller).

**Real-World Applications:** Arithmetic series appear everywhere - calculating total savings over time, finding areas under linear graphs, determining total distances in motion problems.

**Finding the Number of Terms:** Sometimes you need to figure out how many terms you're adding. Use: $n = \frac{a_n - a_1}{d} + 1$

**Partial Sums:** You can find the sum of any consecutive portion of an arithmetic sequence using these same formulas.

### Application

#### Examples

##### Example 1: Basic Series Calculation
Let's solve this step by step: Find the sum of the first 10 terms of the arithmetic sequence 3, 7, 11, 15, ...

Here's how we approach this systematically:

**Method 1: Using the First Formula**

$a_1 = 3, d = 4, n = 10 \quad \text{(identify our known values)}$

$S_{10} = \frac{10}{2}[2(3) + (10-1) \times 4] \quad \text{(substitute into the formula)}$

$S_{10} = 5[6 + 9 \times 4] = 5[6 + 36] = 5 \times 42 = 210 \quad \text{(calculate step by step)}$

**Method 2: Using the Second Formula**

$a_{10} = 3 + (10-1) \times 4 = 3 + 36 = 39 \quad \text{(find the last term first)}$

$S_{10} = \frac{10}{2}(3 + 39) = 5 \times 42 = 210 \quad \text{(same answer - good check!)}$

##### Example 2: Real-World Application
Here's a problem you might encounter: A theater has 20 rows. The first row has 15 seats, and each subsequent row has 3 more seats than the previous row. How many seats are there in total?

This might look different, but it's actually an arithmetic series problem in disguise!

**Method 1: Identify the Pattern**

$\text{Seats per row: } 15, 18, 21, 24, ... \quad \text{(this is our arithmetic sequence)}$

$a_1 = 15, d = 3, n = 20 \quad \text{(extract the series parameters)}$

$S_{20} = \frac{20}{2}[2(15) + (20-1) \times 3] \quad \text{(apply our formula)}$

$S_{20} = 10[30 + 19 \times 3] = 10[30 + 57] = 10 \times 87 = 870 \quad \text{(total seats)}$

##### Example 3: Finding Missing Information
This challenge might seem complex initially, but let's work through it together: The sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic series is 84. If the first term is 2 and the last term is 22, find n and the common difference.

The key insight is to use what we know to find what we need:

**Method 1: Using Known Information**

$S_n = 84, a_1 = 2, a_n = 22 \quad \text{(organize our known values)}$

$84 = \frac{n}{2}(2 + 22) = \frac{n}{2} \times 24 = 12n \quad \text{(substitute into the simpler formula)}$

$n = 84 \div 12 = 7 \quad \text{(solve for number of terms)}$

$22 = 2 + (7-1) \times d \Rightarrow 20 = 6d \Rightarrow d = \frac{20}{6} = \frac{10}{3} \quad \text{(find common difference)}$

**Verification:** Let's check our answer makes sense by calculating the series: 2, 5⅓, 8⅔, 12, 15⅓, 18⅔, 22

### Key Takeaways

```{important}
1. **Sum formulas**: \\(S_n = \\frac{n}{2}[2a_1 + (n-1)d]\\) or \\(S_n = \\frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n)\\) - choose based on known information
2. **Series vs sequence**: A sequence lists terms; a series adds them up
3. **Real-world power**: Series calculate total amounts - savings, distances, loads, scores
4. **Choose your formula**: Use \\(S_n = \\frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n)\\) when you know first and last terms
5. **Symmetry property**: Terms equidistant from ends add to the same sum in arithmetic series
6. **Finding n**: Use \\(n = \\frac{a_n - a_1}{d} + 1\\) when you need the number of terms
7. **Quadratic growth**: Arithmetic series sums grow quadratically, not linearly
8. **Verification habit**: Always check your answer by substituting back into the original formula
