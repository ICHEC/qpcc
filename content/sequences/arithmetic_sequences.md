# Arithmetic Sequences

## Patterns Recognition Revision

### Theory

Before we dive into arithmetic sequences, let's take a moment to recall what we know about pattern recognition. Understanding patterns is the foundation that makes arithmetic sequences feel natural and intuitive.

When we look at sequences of numbers, we're essentially detective work - searching for the hidden rule that connects each term to the next. The most fundamental pattern to recognize is the **constant difference** between consecutive terms.

$$\text{First Difference} = a_{n+1} - a_n$$

This simple concept opens the door to understanding one of the most important types of sequences in mathematics.

### Application

#### Examples

##### Example 1: Spotting the Pattern
Let's work through this step by step - can you identify the pattern in: 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, ...?

**Method 1: Calculate Differences**

$8 - 5 = 3 \quad \text{(first difference)}$

$11 - 8 = 3 \quad \text{(second difference - notice it's the same!)}$

$14 - 11 = 3 \quad \text{(the pattern continues)}$

This tells us we have a constant difference of 3, which means this is an arithmetic sequence.

## Arithmetic Sequences

### Theory

Now that we've warmed up with patterns, let's explore one of the most beautiful and useful patterns in mathematics: arithmetic sequences. Here's why they're so important - they appear everywhere in real life, from saving money regularly to calculating distances at constant speeds.

**What Makes a Sequence Arithmetic?**

An arithmetic sequence is simply a sequence where each term is found by adding the same number (called the **common difference**) to the previous term. It's like climbing stairs where each step is exactly the same height.

**The General Formula:**

$$a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$$

Let's break this down because understanding each part is crucial:

• $a_n$ = the nth term (the term we want to find)
• $a_1$ = the first term (our starting point)  
• $d$ = the common difference (how much we add each time)
• $n$ = the position of the term (which term we're looking for)

**Finding the Common Difference:**

The common difference tells us the "step size" of our sequence:

$$d = a_{n+1} - a_n$$

This is the same for any consecutive pair of terms in an arithmetic sequence.

**Key Properties to Remember:**

**Linear Growth:** Arithmetic sequences grow in a straight line when graphed - this is because we're adding the same amount each time.

**Predictability:** Once you know the first term and common difference, you can find any term in the sequence.

**Real-World Connections:** Think about situations where things increase by the same amount regularly - your age each year (difference of 1), saving €20 each week, temperatures rising by 2°C each hour.

**Finding Any Term:** The beautiful thing about the formula $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$ is that it gives us direct access to any term without having to calculate all the terms before it.

**Identifying Arithmetic Sequences:** Here's a helpful way to think about it - if you can find a constant that, when added repeatedly, gives you the next term, you've got an arithmetic sequence.

### Application

#### Examples

##### Example 1: Finding the Formula
Let's work through this problem step by step: Find the general term for the arithmetic sequence 7, 12, 17, 22, ...

Here's how we approach this systematically:

**Method 1: Using the Standard Formula**

$d = 12 - 7 = 5 \quad \text{(calculate the common difference first)}$

$a_1 = 7 \quad \text{(identify our starting term)}$

$a_n = 7 + (n-1) \times 5 \quad \text{(substitute into our general formula)}$

$a_n = 7 + 5n - 5 = 5n + 2 \quad \text{(simplify to get our final answer)}$

**Method 2: Pattern Recognition**

$\text{Term 1: } 7 = 5(1) + 2 \quad \text{(check our pattern)}$

$\text{Term 2: } 12 = 5(2) + 2 \quad \text{(pattern holds!)}$

$\text{Term 3: } 17 = 5(3) + 2 \quad \text{(confirmed - our formula works)}$

##### Example 2: Finding a Specific Term
Here's a typical question you might encounter: In the arithmetic sequence with first term 3 and common difference 8, what is the 15th term?

Let's solve this step by step:

**Method 1: Direct Substitution**

$a_{15} = a_1 + (n-1)d \quad \text{(start with our general formula)}$

$a_{15} = 3 + (15-1) \times 8 \quad \text{(substitute known values)}$

$a_{15} = 3 + 14 \times 8 = 3 + 112 = 115 \quad \text{(calculate to get our answer)}$

**Method 2: Step-by-Step Building**

$\text{Notice: each term is 8 more than the previous} \quad \text{(understand the pattern)}$

$\text{From term 1 to term 15, we add 8 exactly 14 times} \quad \text{(count the steps)}$

$a_{15} = 3 + 14 \times 8 = 115 \quad \text{(same answer, different approach)}$

##### Example 3: Working Backwards
This might look tricky at first, but let's tackle it together: If the 8th term of an arithmetic sequence is 29 and the 12th term is 41, find the first term and common difference.

The key insight here is to use what we know to find what we don't know:

**Method 1: Using Two Equations**

$a_8 = a_1 + 7d = 29 \quad \text{(write equation for 8th term)}$

$a_{12} = a_1 + 11d = 41 \quad \text{(write equation for 12th term)}$

$41 - 29 = (a_1 + 11d) - (a_1 + 7d) = 4d \quad \text{(subtract equations to eliminate } a_1\text{)}$

$12 = 4d \Rightarrow d = 3 \quad \text{(solve for common difference)}$

$29 = a_1 + 7(3) \Rightarrow a_1 = 29 - 21 = 8 \quad \text{(substitute back to find first term)}$

### Key Takeaways

```{important}
1. **General formula**: \\(a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d\\) where \\(a_1\\) is first term and \\(d\\) is common difference
2. **Common difference**: \\(d = a_{n+1} - a_n\\) must be constant for all consecutive terms
3. **Linear growth**: Arithmetic sequences always graph as straight lines - that's your visual check!
4. **Any term accessible**: You can jump directly to any term using the formula without calculating all previous terms
5. **Working backwards**: Given any two terms, you can find the first term and common difference
6. **Real-world patterns**: Look for situations where quantities increase or decrease by the same amount regularly
7. **Negative differences**: When \\(d < 0\\), the sequence decreases - perfectly valid and often useful
8. **Zero difference**: When \\(d = 0\\), all terms are the same - a constant sequence is still arithmetic
