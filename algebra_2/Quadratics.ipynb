    "## Linear Equations Revision\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into quadratic equations, it's worth taking a moment to review linear equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear equations are a class of polynomial[^1] equations that can be rearranged into the **standard form**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ax + b = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $a$ and $b$ are any constant numbers (with $a \\neq 0$), and $x$ is the variable we're solving for[^2]. Once in this form, solving for $x$ requires just a couple of steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ax + b = 0$$\n",
    "$$ax = -b$$\n",
    "$$x = -\\frac{b}{a}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We first isolate the $x$ term by subtracting $b$ from both sides, then divide by $a$ to get $x$ on its own.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear equations get their name because they create straight lines when graphed. They're also called \"first-order equations\" or \"equations of degree 1\" because the highest power of $x$ is 1 (since $x$ could also be written as $x^1$).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "#### Example 1\n",
    "Let's solve: $3x + 9 = 3$\n",

    "## Quadratic Equations and their Form\n",
    "\n",
    "Quadratic equations are the next step up from linear equations in the polynomial family. They have the following **standard form**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ax^2 + bx + c = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are constants (with $a \\neq 0$), and $x$ is our variable. What makes an equation quadratic is the presence of that $x^2$ term — the **highest** power of $x$ must be 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Getting quadratic equations into this standard form serves two main purposes:\n",
    "1. It's the starting point for solving them using standard techniques\n",
    "2. The coefficients $a$, $b$, and $c$ reveal important information about the graph of the equation\n",
    "\n",
    "If you can transform another type of equation into quadratic form without violating any mathematical rules, you can use quadratic techniques to solve problems that might otherwise seem challenging.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples: Identifying and Working with Quadratic Equations\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 1: Expanding brackets\n",
    "\n",
    "Is this a quadratic equation?\n",
    "\n",
    "$$2x(x+3) = -x$$\n",
    "\n",
    "To find out, we'll expand the brackets and bring everything to one side:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$2x(x+3) = -x$$\n",
    "$$2x^2 + 6x = -x$$\n",
    "$$2x^2 + 7x = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes! This is a quadratic equation where $a=2$, $b=7$, and $c=0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 2: Substitution method\n",
    "\n",
    "Is this a quadratic equation?\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x^4 + x^2 + 1 = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "At first glance, no—the highest power is 4, not 2. However, we can use a clever substitution. Let's define $t = x^2$ and see what happens:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x^4 + x^2 + 1 = 0$$\n",
    "$$(x^2)^2 + x^2 + 1 = 0$$\n",
    "$$t^2 + t + 1 = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We've transformed it into a quadratic equation in terms of $t$, where $a=1$, $b=1$, and $c=1$. After solving for $t$, we can find $x$ using $t = x^2$. This substitution trick appears frequently in exams and is worth mastering.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 3: Trigonometric substitution\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\tan^2(x) + \\tan(x) + 2 = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This follows the same logic as Example 2. We can let $t = \\tan(x)$ and substitute:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\tan^2(x) + \\tan(x) + 2 = 0$$\n",
    "$$t^2 + t + 2 = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we have a quadratic in $t$ with $a=1$, $b=1$, and $c=2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 4: Not all equations with $x^2$ are quadratic\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\tan(x) + x^2 + 5 = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite having an $x^2$ term, this is not a quadratic equation. If we try to substitute $t = \\tan(x)$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$t + x^2 + 5 = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We end up with two different variables ($t$ and $x$), and no way to convert between them. The presence of the trigonometric function $\\tan(x)$ alongside the polynomial term $x^2$ prevents this from being converted to quadratic form.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 5: Functions with constants\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x^2\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) + x = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Although it involves a trigonometric term, this **is** a quadratic equation because $\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)$ evaluates to a constant (approximately 0.866). The equation has the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ax^2 + bx + c = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $a = \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)$, $b = 1$, and $c = 0$.\n",

    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A quadratic equation has the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ where $a \\neq 0$\n",
    "2. Equations can often be rewritten or transformed into quadratic form\n",
    "3. Using substitution, we can convert some higher-degree equations into quadratics\n",
    "4. Not all equations containing $x^2$ are quadratics, especially if they contain other non-polynomial functions of $x$\n",
    "5. A trigonometric expression that doesn't contain $x$ as a variable acts as a constant in the equation"

    "## Factorizing Quadratic Equations by Inspection\n",
    "\n",
    "Factorizing by inspection is the most intuitive approach to solving quadratic equations. At its core, factorization means breaking down an expression into simpler parts that multiply together to give the original expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding the Concept\n",
    "\n",
    "When we have a quadratic equation in standard form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ax^2 + bx + c = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Factorizing means rewriting it as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$(px + q)(rx + s) = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $p$, $q$, $r$, and $s$ are constants we need to find. The beauty of this approach is that once factorized, the solutions become immediately apparent thanks to the **zero product property**: if a product equals zero, at least one of the factors must be zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Factorizing by inspection works best when:\n",
    "- The coefficients are \"nice\" integers (no messy fractions or surds)\n",
    "- You have strong pattern recognition skills\n",
    "- You need a quick solution without using formulas\n",
    "\n",
    "If you see fractions, decimals, or square roots in your coefficients, you're probably better off using the quadratic formula directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Factorizing Process\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break down the approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Ensure your equation is in standard form with zero on the right side\n",
    "2. Look for two numbers that:\n",
    "   - Multiply to give $ac$ (the product of the first and last coefficients)\n",
    "   - Add up to give $b$ (the middle coefficient)\n",
    "3. Use these numbers to split the middle term and create your factors\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Step by Step\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's work through:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x^2 + 2x - 8 = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1:** We need to find two numbers that multiply to give $-8$ (which is $a \\times c = 1 \\times -8$) and add up to give $+2$ (our $b$ value).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2:** Let's list possible number pairs that multiply to give $-8$:\n",
    "- $1 \\times -8 = -8$ (sum: $1 + (-8) = -7$)\n",
    "- $2 \\times -4 = -8$ (sum: $2 + (-4) = -2$)\n",
    "- $-1 \\times 8 = -8$ (sum: $-1 + 8 = 7$)\n",
    "- $-2 \\times 4 = -8$ (sum: $-2 + 4 = 2$) ← This works!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3:** Now we've found our pair: $-2$ and $4$. Let's use them to split the middle term:\n",
    "$x^2 + 2x - 8 = x^2 - 2x + 4x - 8$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4:** Group the terms in pairs and factor each pair:\n",
    "$x^2 - 2x + 4x - 8 = x(x - 2) + 4(x - 2)$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 5:** Factor out the common term $(x - 2)$:\n",
    "$x(x - 2) + 4(x - 2) = (x + 4)(x - 2)$\n",
    "\n",
    "So our factorized equation is:\n",
    "$$(x + 4)(x - 2) = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Finding the Solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have factorized the equation, the solutions are straightforward:\n",
    "\n",
    "If $(x + 4)(x - 2) = 0$, then either:\n",
    "- $x + 4 = 0$, which gives $x = -4$\n",
    "- $x - 2 = 0$, which gives $x = 2$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can verify these solutions:\n",
    "- For $x = -4$: $(-4)^2 + 2(-4) - 8 = 16 - 8 - 8 = 0$ ✓\n",
    "- For $x = 2$: $(2)^2 + 2(2) - 8 = 4 + 4 - 8 = 0$ ✓\n",
    "\n",
    "$x = 2$ and $x = -4$ are the **roots** of the quadratic equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### When the Leading Coefficient Isn't 1\n",
    "\n",
    "When the coefficient of $x^2$ isn't 1 (i.e., $a \\neq 1$), factorizing by inspection becomes more challenging because we have more combinations to consider.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two approaches for these cases:\n",
    "1. First multiply everything by $a$ to make the coefficient of $x^2$ equal to $a^2$, then find factors where the outer terms multiply to give $a^2 \\times c$\n",
    "2. Use the quadratic formula directly (which we'll cover in a later section)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaway\n",
    "\n",
    "Factorizing by inspection relies on pattern recognition and understanding the relationship between the coefficients and the factors. While it's not always applicable, it's often the quickest method when it works. As you practice, you'll develop an intuition for when to use this approach versus the quadratic formula."

    "#### Understanding the Parabola\n",
    "\n",
    "When we solve quadratic equations in the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, we're searching for values of $x$ that make the expression equal to zero. But what happens if we evaluate this expression for many different values of $x$?\n",
    "\n",
    "If we plot these inputs and outputs on a coordinate plane, with $x$ on the horizontal axis and the result on the vertical axis, we get a distinctive U-shaped curve called a **parabola**. This graphical representation lets us visualize quadratic equations in a powerful way:\n",

    "Where $y$ represents the output value for any given input $x$.\n",

    "#### Key Insights from Graphing Quadratics\n",
    "\n",
    "The graph of a quadratic equation reveals several important features:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **X-intercepts**: The points where the parabola crosses the x-axis are precisely the solutions to the quadratic equation. At these points, $y = 0$, which means they satisfy our original equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Vertex** (turning point): The lowest point of the parabola (if $a > 0$) or highest point (if $a < 0$) indicates where the function changes direction. If this point lies exactly on the x-axis, it means the equation has a repeated root.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Number of solutions**: A parabola can:\n",
    "   - Cross the x-axis twice (two distinct real solutions)\n",
    "   - Touch the x-axis once (one repeated real solution)\n",
    "   - Never cross the x-axis (two complex solutions)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Completing the Square\n",

    "Another useful way to express quadratic expressions is in \"completed square form\":\n",
    "\n",
    "$$a(x + p)^2 + q$$\n",

    "Where $a$, $p$, and $q$ are constants. This form provides immediate insight into the graph's shape and position:\n",
    "- $a$ determines whether the parabola opens upward ($a > 0$) or downward ($a < 0$)\n",
    "- $p$ tells us the horizontal shift of the vertex (it's at $x = -p$)\n",
    "- $q$ gives us the y-coordinate of the vertex\n",
    "\n",
    "Converting from standard form to completed square form is a technique called \"completing the square,\" which is also the foundation for deriving the quadratic formula.\n",

    "#### The Process of Completing the Square\n",
    "\n",
    "To convert $ax^2 + bx + c$ to $a(x + p)^2 + q$:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Factor out the coefficient $a$ from the first two terms\n",
    "2. Complete the square for the expression inside the parentheses\n",

On occasion it's faster to factorise by inspection rather than go through the formula, especially if the factorisation is very obvious, but it's important to remember the quadratic formula every time there are roots to find.\n"

    "## The Discriminant: Understanding the Nature of Quadratic Solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "The discriminant is a powerful mathematical tool that reveals the nature of a quadratic equation's solutions before you even solve it. It acts as a \"solution predictor\" by examining what happens under the square root in the quadratic formula.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theory\n",
    "#### What is the Discriminant?\n",
    "\n",
    "For any quadratic equation in standard form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, the discriminant (denoted by $\\Delta$) is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Delta = b^2 - 4ac$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This expression appears under the square root in the quadratic formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{\\Delta}}{2a}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Three Scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "The value of the discriminant determines both the number and type of solutions:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Case 1: Positive Discriminant ($\\Delta > 0$)\n",
    "- **Algebraically**: The equation has two distinct real solutions\n",
    "- **Graphically**: The parabola crosses the x-axis at two different points\n",
    "- **Example**: For $x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0$:\n",
    "  - $\\Delta = (-5)^2 - 4(1)(6) = 25 - 24 = 1 > 0$\n",
    "  - Solutions are $x = 2$ and $x = 3$ (two distinct real roots)\n",
    "  - The parabola crosses the x-axis at $x = 2$ and $x = 3$\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Case 2: Zero Discriminant ($\\Delta = 0$)\n",
    "- **Algebraically**: The equation has exactly one repeated real solution\n",
    "- **Graphically**: The parabola touches the x-axis exactly once at its vertex\n",
    "- **Example**: For $x^2 - 6x + 9 = 0$:\n",
    "  - $\\Delta = (-6)^2 - 4(1)(9) = 36 - 36 = 0$\n",
    "  - The only solution is $x = 3$ (repeated twice)\n",
    "  - The parabola's vertex is at $(3,0)$, just touching the x-axis\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Case 3: Negative Discriminant ($\\Delta < 0$)\n",
    "- **Algebraically**: The equation has two complex solutions (not real numbers)\n",
    "- **Graphically**: The parabola never intersects the x-axis\n",
    "- **Example**: For $x^2 + 1 = 0$:\n",
    "  - $\\Delta = 0^2 - 4(1)(1) = -4 < 0$\n",
    "  - Solutions are $x = \\pm i$ (complex numbers)\n",
    "  - The parabola sits entirely above the x-axis with vertex at $(0,1)$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why Does This Matter?\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the discriminant helps you:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Predict solutions** without solving the entire equation\n",
    "2. **Choose solution methods** appropriately\n",
    "3. **Verify answers** by checking if they match the expected number of solutions\n",
    "4. **Understand the graphical meaning** of quadratic equations\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Discriminant and Factorization\n",
    "\n",
    "The discriminant also tells us about factorization possibilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "- When $\\Delta > 0$: The quadratic can be factored into two different linear factors with real coefficients\n",
    "- When $\\Delta = 0$: The quadratic can be factored as a perfect square: $(x - r)^2$\n",
    "- When $\\Delta < 0$: The quadratic cannot be factored with real coefficients\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Complex Numbers and Beyond\n",
    "\n",
    "When $\\Delta < 0$, we enter the realm of complex numbers. Though these solutions don't appear on the standard coordinate plane, they're still valid mathematically. For instance, $x^2 + 1 = 0$ has solutions $x = \\pm i$, where $i = \\sqrt{-1}$ is the imaginary unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Complex solutions always appear in conjugate pairs (if $a + bi$ is a solution, then $a - bi$ is also a solution), reflecting the symmetry we see in real solutions as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The discriminant provides immediate insight into the nature of a quadratic equation's solutions:\n",
    "- $\\Delta > 0$: Two distinct real solutions\n",
    "- $\\Delta = 0$: One repeated real solution\n",
    "- $\\Delta < 0$: Two complex solutions (no real solutions)\n",
    "\n",
    "This single value connects algebra, geometry, and number theory in a remarkably elegant way."
