    "\n",
    "## Quadratic Equations and their Form\n",
    "\n",
    "Quadratic equations, much like linear equations, are a special class of polynomial equations that have the following standard form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ax^2 + bx + c = 0$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $a$, $b$, $c$ are numbers and $x$ is again, the variable. Like linear equations, they might need to be moved around to get to this form. You'll notice that there's two $x$ terms - an $x^2$ and an $x$. It's the presence of the $x^2$ that makes this equation quadratic - the **highest** power of the $x$ is 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main reason we want quadratic equations in this standard form is that this is the starting point for solving them (the secondary reason is that this form contains some useful graphical information). Also, if you can convince another equation to shift into quadratic form without breaking any mathematical rules, you can also apply quadratic techniques to solve equations you otherwise couldn't.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Is the following a quadratic equation?\n",
    "\n",
    "$2x(x+3) = -x$\n",
    "\n",
    "All we need to do here is multiply out the brackets and bring everything to one side:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{gather*}2x(x+3) = -x\\\\\n",
    "2x(x) + 2x(3) = -x\\\\\n",
    "2x^2 + 6x = -x\\\\\n",
    "2x^2 + 7x = 0\\end{gather*}\n",
    "\n",
    "and we have a quadratic where $a=2$, $b=7$ and $c=0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Is the following a quadratic equation?\n",
    "\n",
    "$x^4 + x^2 + 1 = 0$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the highest power on $x$ isn't $2$, it's $4$, technically, this isn't a quadratic. But we can choose a new variable, say, $t$, and say that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$t = x^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "If we then substitute it in, noting that $x^4=(x^2)(x^2)$:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{gather*}x^4 + x^2 + 1 = 0\\\\\n",
    "(x^2)(x^2) + x^2 + 1 = 0\\\\\n",
    "(t)(t) + (t) + 1 = 0\\\\\n",
    "t^2 + t + 1 = 0\\end{gather*}\n",
    "\n",
    "and suddenly, we get a quadratic form that we can solve, where $a=1$, $b=1$ and $c=1$. Once we find an answer for $t$, then we work backwards from $t=x^2$ to find $x$. This is a common trick they pull in the Leaving Cert that's worth getting comfortable with.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 3\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\tan^2(x) + \\tan(x) + 2 = 0$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is quite similar to the last question. We choose (maybe after some trial and error) to let $t = \\tan(x)$, and then substitute in:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{gather*}\\tan^2(x) + \\tan(x) + 2 = 0\\\\\n",
    "\\tan(x)\\tan(x) + \\tan(x) + 2 = 0\\\\\n",
    "(t)(t) + t + 2 = 0\\\\\n",
    "t^2 + t + 2 = 0\\end{gather*}\n",
    "\n",
    "and now we have a quadratic again, where $a=1$, $b=1$ and $c=2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 4\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{gather}\n",
    "\\tan(x) + x^2 + 5 = 0\n",
    "\\end{gather}\n",
    "\n",
    "The highest power on the $x$ is $2$, but this is not actually a quadratic equation. We can't just let $t = \\tan(x)$ again, because we'll end up with:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{gather}\n",
    "\\tan(x) + x^2 = 0\n",
    "t + x^2 = 0\n",
    "\\end{gather}\n",
    "\n",
    "Which doesn't get us very far, since now we have 2 unknowns and not enough information to find either. Try all you want, but there's no real way to get this into a quadratic form since $\\tan(x)$ is a trigonometric function - not a constant multiplying $x$, which is what we require of our polynomial coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 5\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{gather}\n",
    "x^2\\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{3}) + x = 0\n",
    "\\end{gather}\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, despite $\\sin$ showing up, this is a quadratic, since (and you can type this into your calculator to check) $\\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{3})$ is just a number (0.866, a constant). In this case, it meets the requirements for a quadratic expression - here we have $a=\\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{3})$, $b=1$ and $c=0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Factorising by Inspection\n",
    "\n",
    "Factorising by inspection is the most straightforward way of solving quadratic equations. Factorisation is the process of splitting a number or an algebraic expression into a product of terms, doing it \"by inspection\" is basically us hoping that we can spot those terms that form the right product. The downside to this method is that not all quadratic equations have nice enough $a$, $b$, $c$ to be able to have a simple factorisation we can spot - if you see a fraction or a surd you're almost always better off using other methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way to do this is to break the equation apart into two brackets, which multiply together to give $0$ (since in the standard from, the equations ends with \"$=0$\"). We know that anything multiplied by $0$ is $0$, so if the two brackets get multiplied together, we can conclude that one of the brackets must be $0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{gather}\n",
    "(x+...)(x+...)=0\n",
    "\\end{gather}\n",
    "\n",
    "Most learn how to do this type of factorising for Junior Cert and everyone has their own methods - you should stick to what you're most comfortable with. The thing all methods have in common is that you can guess at the ingredients by looking at the finished product and then do a little trial-and-error to get it right.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Take for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{gather}\n",
    "x^2 + 2x - 8=0\n",
    "\\end{gather}\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see that there's an $x^2$, so we need to make sure there's an $x$ in each bracket to multiply with each other. Similarly, we'll need two numbers that will multiply with each other to give us the $-8$ at the end. So, we've restricted the possible bracket combinations significantly by noticing these two things.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pairs of numbers that multiply to give $8$ are $1$ and $8$, and $2$ and $4$ (we can take care of the minus part of the $8$ by putting a minus in front of either number in a pair).\n",
    "\n",
    "We can either:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Try to put both of these into the bracket pairs we're building and check if they give us the right method, or\n",
    "2. Notice that we can build the $2$ part of the $2x$ middle term by using one pair specifically: $4-2=2$\n",
    "\n",
    "This points to using them to build our brackets:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{gather}\n",
    "(x+4)(x-2) = 0\n",
    "x(x-2)+4(x-2) = 0\n",
    "x^2 -2x +4x -8 = 0\n",
    "x^2 +2x -8 = 0\n",
    "\\end{gather}\n",
    "\n",
    "which is what we want.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solving the Factored Equation\n",
    "\n",
    "If we go on to solve this, having factorised:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{gather}\n",
    "(x+4)(x-2) = 0\n",
    "\\end{gather}\n",
    "\n",
    "Either:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $x + 4 = 0$\n",
    "  * Therefore $x = -4$\n",
    "* Or $x - 2 = 0$\n",
    "  * Therefore $x = +2$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can verify these solutions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* For $x=-4$: $(-4)^2 + 2(-4)-8=16-8-8=0$\n",
    "* For $x=2$: $(2)^2 + 2(2) - 8 = 4+4-8=0$\n",
    "\n",
    "Either one of these solutions make the value of the quadratic expression $x^2 + 2x -8$ go to $0$, which is what we want since the equation ends with $=0$. $x=2$ and $x=-4$ are known as the **roots** of $x^2 +2x-8$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, the $a$ coefficient multiplying the $x^2$ term will not just be $1$. This is a little trickier, because it means we have a wider amount of combinations of brackets to consider.\n",
    "\n",
    "While your Junior Cert teacher will likely have given a technique to deal with these $a\\ne 1$ quadratic equations, but if not don't worry; you can skip right to the solution without factorisation by inspection via the \"quadratic formula\", see Section on Quadratic Formula.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Graphical Solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "If you look at what we've been solving for so far, we've been searching for values of $x$ that can make a quadratic expression become $0$ - there are at most two $x$ values that can bring this about for a given quadratic expression. However, we can start putting any values of $x$ into:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{gather}\n",
    "ax^2 + bx + c = ?\n",
    "\\end{gather}\n",
    "\n",
    "and just keep track of what comes out. This idea of feeding an \"input\" and getting an \"output\" is precisely what we come across when dealing with functions - which is why you'll see that question mark replaced with $f(x)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we write down every value of $x$ we put in, and then we write down every value we get out, and then mark those pairs of input/output on an $x$-$y$ graph, we'll get out a nice shape called a \"parabola\". If we do this, the convention is to call the \"?\" in the equation above $y$ to reflect the idea that the output is on the y-axis of the graph. This parabola shape on a graph is a key feature of quadratic equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "But all that work we did finding the $x$ values at $y=0$ previously wasn't for nothing. If you plot any parabola, you'll find that the places where it crosses the $x$-axis are exactly the solutions we found earlier. This is because at every single spot along an $x$-axis, $y=0$. So if $y=0$, and we solve the equation, what we're really doing is solving the equation in standard form.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key points about x-intercepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "* They can be used as a method to solve any quadratic equation\n",
    "* They are the points where the curve \"intercepts\" the x-axis\n",
    "* They represent the solutions to the quadratic equation\n",
    "\n",
    "If it just so happens that the parabola only touches the $x$-axis at a single point - that is it touches the $x$-axis as it turns - then the two solutions to the equation are both the same number. This point as it turns is sometimes called the \"vertex\" or the \"turning point\".\n",
    "\n",
    "You may notice that it is entirely possible to have a parabola in such a way that it never touches the $x$-axis. Without spoiling too much of a future chapter, these equations have solutions that are \"not real\", i.e., you need complex numbers to understand account for their solutions, which you will see later in the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Completing the Square\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides standard form, there are a few other forms that you can move quadratic equations into. One was the factorised form. Another, which we'll do here, is the completed square form. It looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{gather}\n",
    "f(x + d)^2 + e\n",
    "\\end{gather}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $f$, $d$ and $e$ are constants. This form is useful for giving us information about the shape and location of the parabola when graphed. Completing the square is also the method used to derive the \"minus b\" formula - a derivation which is on the syllabus but has never been asked!\n",
    "\n",
    "*Sidenote*: for the Leaving Cert exam, however, you do need to know how to *do* the method of completing the square, as there will be questions where you'll be asked to solve equations specifically by completing the square.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general method relies on guessing $d$ to give us the right $a$ and $b$ terms from the standard form, then adding or subtracting constants until we match our standard form constant $c$. This is best shown through examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Take for example the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{gather}\n",
    "x^2 + 3x - 4\n",
    "\\end{gather}\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to get this to completed square form, meaning we will have a $(x + d)^2$ when we finish. We want to choose $d$ so that we can get out the $+3x$ term. Maybe the most straightforward way to see what $d$ should be is to multiply out:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "5(x+d)^2 &= 5x^2 + 10dx + 5d^2 \\\\\n",
    "\\implies 10dx &= 2x \\\\\n",
    "\\implies d &= \\frac{2}{10}\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "All we need to do is check that we have the $x^2$ term we want before we move on - and sure enough:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{gather}\n",
    "(x+\\frac{3}{2})^2 = x^2 + 3x + \\frac{9}{4}\n",
    "\\end{gather}\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that we let $f = 1$. We've established what $d$ must be, and because the $e$ is going to be just a constant, we don't need to worry about it affecting the $bx$ term - $d$ is the only thing that controls $b$. Now, using $d=\\frac{3}{2}$, let's pay attention to the extra constant term spat out during squaring:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "(x+d)^2 &= \\left(x + \\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2 \\\\\n",
    "&= x^2 + 3x + \\frac{9}{4}\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Now comes the tinkering. We're aiming for a $c=-4$, but what we have right now is a $\\frac{9}{4}$. We also have the free choice of $e$. So we want to add (or subtract) numbers to get that $\\frac{9}{4}$ to $-4$:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",

    "\n",
    "## Discriminant\n",
    "\n",
    "You may have noticed somewhere that not all our methods give answers for all quadratic equations - but you will have seen in the video series that not all parabolas hit the x-axis. When this happens, our minus-b quadratic formula ends up trying to find the square root of a negative number. Take for example this very simple problem:\n",

    "\\begin{gather}\n",

    "\n",
    "In fact, yes they do have solutions, even if not on the x-axis; the way to solve these is to extend our number line (in these cases, the real number line) to account for the square root of a negative number. This larger set of numbers is called the set of complex numbers. This will be covered in another part of your course - there's a lot of interesting things to be done in the complex number line.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, what we need to know is how to tell the difference between a problem that we can solve in the real numbers and a problem that we need the complex numbers for - or, alternatively, the difference between a parabola that touches the $x$-axis or doesn't.\n",
    "\n",
    "We do this by looking at the \"discriminant\", which is the part of the quadratic/minus b formula under the square root - the part that gives us problems when it's negative. In other words, the discriminant (which we will denote with $\\Delta$) is:\n",

    "  * The parabola crosses the $x$-axis at these two values of $x$\n",

    "## Higher Order Polynomials\n",
    "\n",
    "The same way that \"quadratic\" refers to a polynomial of degree 2, we can have polynomials of degree 3 (\"cubic\"), or 4 (\"quartic\"). When graphed, they no longer have a parabola shape, but instead have extra turns - the higher order the polynomial is, the more turns it will have. Similar rules to quadratic functions dictate how higher order polynomials look when graphed. We will briefly consider these, as they are handy for visualising functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If the degree of a function is odd, then the \"arms\" (the parts of the function before and after the twists and turns where the function is constantly increasing/decreasing) will go in opposite directions. If the degree is even, the arms will go in the same direction.\n",
    "2. If the leading coefficient (the constant term multiplied by the highest power of $x$) is positive, then the arm on the right hand side will go up. Otherwise, it will go down. To figure out what the left hand side arm is doing, check if the degree is odd or even.\n",
    "3. The $y$-intercept, as learned in linear equations, holds here too: the constant term at the end that doesn't have any $x$ multiplied by it is the $y$-intercept, and this is the point that the graph cuts the $y$-axis.\n",
    "4. Substituting $-x$ for $x$ mirrors the graph about the $y$-axis. Multiplying the whole equation by $-1$ (so changing $y$ to $-y$) flips the graph about the $x$-axis.\n",
    "5. Roots that appear only once are the line crossing the $x$-axis. Roots that appear twice are the line touching the $x$-axis as it turns. Roots that appear three times are the line passing through the $x$-axis but which briefly flatten as it does so (to test this: graph $y = x^3$, which has the root $x=0$ three times, to see this shape in action).\n",
    "6. If you multiply a polynomial by a constant, it makes the amplitude larger by that amount i.e., it stretches the graph vertically by that amount.\n",
    "7. Local minima/maxima* are the lowest/highest points on a graph in their immediate area. We want these to be \"local\" as the arms of polynomials can stretch on to infinity whilst constantly increasing/decreasing, so overall, the minimum/maximum would be at $\\pm\\infty$.\n",
